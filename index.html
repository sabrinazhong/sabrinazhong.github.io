	<h1>Hi, I'm Sabrina Zhong!</h1>
	<img src="headshot.jpg" alt="" class="">
	<p>I'm a linguist. I completed my master degree in Linguisitcs at Georgetown University, with a concentration
	   in sociolinguistics. My research projects concentrated on discourse analysis and language variation, and ranged
           over from identity construction, speech perception, and how meanings are created and negotiated in communication.
	   After graduated from Georgetown, I worked in natural language understanding and created language data structures
	   for Google Assistant. </p>
	<p>Check out my <a href="/blog"> blog </a> to see some of my analysis of language use in real
	   life. </p>
