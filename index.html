	<p>I'm a linguist. I completed my master degree in Linguisitcs at Georgetown University, with a concentration
	   in sociolinguistics. My research projects concentrated on discourse analysis and language variation, and ranged
           over identity construction, speech perception, and how meanings are created and negotiated in communication.
	   After graduation, I worked in natural language understanding and created language data structures for Google
	   Assistant. </p>

	   life. </p>
