This paper analyzes the discursive construction of Asian Americans as “racial others” in
the US by examining direct reported speech in narratives by Asian Americans about their daily
experiences. It investigates positioning, or discursive process whereby selves are located in
interaction (Davies and Harré, 1990), of Asian Americans in California about their experiences
of being positioned as “racial others.” Through pragmatic processes—implicature and presupposition, Asian
Americans are positioned as “illegitimate Americans” or “foreigners”, or in general “racial others”
discursively by members of other ethnic groups in their daily interaction. The use of direct
reported speech polarizes the ideologies of the racial binary —“insiders” (White Americans) and
“illegitimate Americans”/“foreigners”/“others” (Asian Americans). Taking one segment from my data as an example. After a Chinese American, who was
born and raised in the US, told a White American that he was from Berkeley, California, he was
still asked the question “no, no, where are you really from?” The question presupposed that the
Chinese American was regarded as coming from some other country and therefore, not a
legitimate American that is expected to be White. The use of direct reported speech constructed
White people as someone who have more authority and power in licensing the membership of
“insider,” which is in opposition to the narrators as minorities. The study contributes to the literature in both interactional sociolinguistics and
anthropology on discursively positioning Asian Americans as “racial others” by examining the
positioning mechanism.
