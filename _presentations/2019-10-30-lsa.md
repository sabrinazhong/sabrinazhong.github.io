title: "Rhythm and perception of ethnicity: a perception experiment of sounding 'Asian'"
date: 2019-01
---

This speech perception experiment investigates the relationship between rhythm and perception of Asian ethnicity. The
results of a pilot study show that the variety of English spoken by 2nd generation Asian-Americans in California is 
distinguishable from the mainstream variety for Californians but not for non-Californians. Linguistic experience with 
the language varieties spoken in California is a significant factor in the perceptual evaluation of ethnicity. Californians 
performed better at the identification with the syllable-timed utterances. Participants’ diverse responses to the 
Asian-American speaker’s ethnicity further purpose a broad category as sounding “non-white”—many participants successfully 
identified the target voices as produced by an ethnic minority but failed to identify the speaker as Asian.
