This research examines the responses of a police officer in a sociolinguistic interview to explore how he uses language
to index simultaneous identities via positioning (Davis and Harr√©, 1990). It also investigates how intertextuality
contributes to identity construction. By examining the membership categorization devices (Sacks, 1972), the analysis
reveals that the police officer positions himself and other police as members in various social categories to create a
sense of sameness with other members (Bamberg, 2009). It also shows that intertextuality functions as a source for meaning
making and constructing membership, which ultimately creates a sense of sameness with others.
