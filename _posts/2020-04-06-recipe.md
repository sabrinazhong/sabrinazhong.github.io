<i><h3>Keywords: NLP, Named Entity Recognition, Python, Baking</h3></i>

I am a beginner baker, and the first recipe I wanted to try was a chocolate chip cookies recipe. Chewy chocolate chip cookies are my all-time favorite. I found tons of recipes online that all claim to be the best, ultimate, and perfect recipes you would ever need. I randomly picked one that seemed promising, but I was not very happy with the results. After several attempts, I came up with the idea: what if I wrote some codes and let the computer make a recipe for me?

The basic idea is to first scrape ‘best’ chocolate chip cookies recipes from different web pages. Then, I build a custom Named Entity Recognition model using spaCy to extract information. The information is organized in Pandas DataFrame. Finally, an ‘average’ best chewy chocolate chip cookies recipe will be calculated.

<h3>Scrape Recipes from Food Network</h3>

The source for collecting recipes for this mini-project was the official website of the American <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/">Food Network</a> channel . The keywords for searching were ‘chewy chocolate chip cookies.’ I manually selected the recipes from the results based on the photo along with each recipe and the rating. (I could have selected the recipes solely by rating, but I did want to have a look at the goods to make sure they were something that I was actually looking for.) Beautiful Soup was used to parse and extract ingredient texts from each website. The texts were then written into two comma-separated values (CSV) files—one for the training data and the other for the testing data.

<h3>Build Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) Model</h3>

The custom NER model was built on an existing pretrained spaCy NER model (using its library en_core_web_lg). The pretrained model can only recognize the QUANTITY entity type in the ingredient texts.
